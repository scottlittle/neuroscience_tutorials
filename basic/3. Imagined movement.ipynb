    "# 3. Imagined movement\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will look at imagined movement. Our movement is controlled in the motor cortex where there is an increased level of mu activity (8â€“12 Hz) when we perform movements. This is accompanied by a reduction of this mu activity in specific regions that deal with the limb that is currently moving. This decrease is called Event Related Desynchronization (ERD). By measuring the amount of mu activity at different locations on the motor cortex, we can determine which limb the subject is moving. Through mirror neurons, this effect also occurs when the subject is not actually moving his limbs, but merely imagining it.\n",
